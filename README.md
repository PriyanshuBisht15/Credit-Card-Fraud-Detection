# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project involves analyzing a credit card transaction dataset (`creditcard.csv`) to detect fraudulent activities. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
## Dataset
The dataset (creditcard.csv) consists of anonymized credit card transactions, with the target column Class indicating fraud (1) or legitimate (0).

## Contents
1. **Setup and Libraries**  
   - Importing essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
   - Loading the dataset (`creditcard.csv`) for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Displaying and analyzing the top and bottom rows of the dataset.
   - Examining the shape, column names, and data types.
   - Identifying missing values and outliers.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values and data cleaning.
   - Scaling features (if necessary).
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing data distributions.
   - Identifying correlations between features.
   - Highlighting the class imbalance in the dataset (fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions).

5. **Modeling and Evaluation**  
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Addressing class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

6. **Results and Insights**  
   - Summary of findings and key insights from the analysis.
   - Suggestions for improving fraud detection systems.
